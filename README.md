# Agentic Game Dev

Agentic Game Dev is an innovative tool that leverages the power of Anthropic's CLAUDE 3.5 Sonnet LLM to create Pygame games through a collaborative multi-agent system.

## Overview

This project spawns 8+ AI agents that work together to design, plan, and implement games using Pygame. The agents handle various aspects of game development, including:

- Game design and mechanics
- Code architecture and file structure
- Implementation of game logic
- Error detection and correction
- Iterative improvements based on user feedback

## Key Features

- Utilizes Anthropic's CLAUDE 3.5 Sonnet LLM as Agents
- Multi-agent collaboration for comprehensive game development
- Automated code generation and error fixing
- Interactive feedback loop for game refinement
- No external assets required - all game elements are generated within Pygame

## Usage

1. Run the script and provide a description of the game you want to create.
2. Specify the number of planning iterations for the AI agents.
3. The system will generate the game files and structure.
4. Play the game and provide feedback for improvements.
5. The AI agents will iteratively refine the game based on your input.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Pygame
- Anthropic API key (set as an environment variable)

## Warning

This script executes code automatically on your machine. Use with caution and only if you understand and accept the potential risks.
